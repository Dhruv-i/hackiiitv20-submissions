We have decided to work upon the problem of healthcare. Aiming to build the expected smart healthcare system.

Our aim is to build a system(because we weren't able to make any app or website) that will move the work online or digitally. 
We have to sub-aims
 - To make an online platform where we can arrange a meet for a person with a doctor which is available in a specific time slot for that disease. (But we haven't been able to        create the platform)
 - To create a database of all the hospitals so that everyone can see how many beds are available(inspired from some personal incident), medicines, staff and all other things to      make effective monitoring.
 
 Some benefits that we thought it would make
 - In rural areas proper medical practices do not take place. So the meet arrangement will help to deal with the problem.
 - In some cases like one happened with my friend his relative was not admitted in the hospital even though he had corona due to some political reasons. In out database we are        going to store each bed and every person that is the on the bed which deal with the problem.
 - Also in some cases doctors wrongly diagonise a person. We will store the medical history of the person and show it to the doctor for assistance. The medicine prescribed by the    doctor will also be stored in our database.
 
We were only able to implement the backend of the problem in a simple way due to some reasons.
